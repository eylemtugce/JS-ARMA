# Learning Graph ARMA Processes from Time-Vertex Spectra

This repository contains the code implementation of a research paper titled ["Learning Graph ARMA Processes from Time-Vertex Spectra"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06887). The paper addresses the problem of learning parametric stochastic graph processes for time-varying graph signals from partially observed realizations. The code estimates the joint time-vertex power spectral density of the process and fits it to a graph autoregressive moving average (graph ARMA) model using convex optimization techniques. Â The missing signal values can be estimated based on the learnt model. The missing signal values can be estimated based on the learnt model.
## Requirements

The code is written in MATLAB and requires the following toolboxes:
- [CVX: A MATLAB-based modeling system for convex optimization .](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/)
## Usage
* Run `cvx_startup.m` file before running the main script.
* Run `experiments\syntheticdata\numberofrealizations\main.m` file for the number of realizations experiment.
